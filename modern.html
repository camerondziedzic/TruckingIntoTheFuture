                    <h1 class="modernbody">Here we will be referring to trucks of the modern day as 2007 to present (2022). Several components have been introduced to these trucks to regulate and minimize the introduction of carbon and other harmful gases into our atmosphere. 3 main additions are the EGR, DPF, and DEF systems.<br>Firstly, the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), is a valve which regulates the mixture of fuel and air. This restricts air from reaching the engine which causes the combustion temperature to lower, reducing nitrogen oxide by up to 70%. Nitrogen oxide is an extremely powerful greenhouse which contributes to climate change 300 times more than just a single cell of carbon dioxide.<br>Previously seen in old school trucks, the DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) was standardized for the purpose of catching soot and exhaust smoke to as little as 1 micron in diameter. Overtime the filters have to be cleaned, have the debris burned off, or be swapped in order to be clear of any soot which restricts the operation of the engine.<br>Lastly, the introduction of DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) is seen. It works in conjunction with another component called the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction). As the truck is running, ammonia within the DEF is dispersed into the SCR which reacts with the nitrous oxide to form water and nitrogen, two less harmful greenhouse gases.<br> With these extra components added to the trucks, there is a slight decrease in the fuel economy as there is a lot of restriction for intake and exhaust, but combined with the lower carbon footprint, it is much more environmentally friendly.</h1>
