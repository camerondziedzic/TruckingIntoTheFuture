                    <h2>Old School</h2>
                    <h1 class="oldschoolbody">In this category we will be referring to the trucks that were built in before 2007-2010 which are the years that emission guidelines were set for diesel trucks which changed the entire design of the engine. Before that, trucks were loud and dirty, things like aerodynamics were not considered as is visible from the image on the left.<br>The truck pictured is referred to as flat nose, or cab-over, as the cab where the driver sits is directly on top of where the engine is. This body style of truck was extremely popular 50 years ago but is very rarely seen nowadays in Northern America as it has bad fuel economy due it’s bad aero dynamics, and smaller displacement engines thus restricting it to pulling smaller loads. Surprisingly in Europe it is one of the only models of truck you will see as they have smaller length requirements. Although it had been mentioned that flat nose trucks have poor aerodynamics, innovations have still been made to make them the best they can be for newer models.<br>Although the design may not have been the best, small steps were still made before 2007 which significantly reduced the carbon footprint of these trucks. As early as 1980, filters we’re starting to be put on diesel trucks called DPF’s (Diesel particulate filters). This reduced the emissions by at least 85%, alongside things like fuel with a lower concentration of sulphur.<br> With great improvements made already to combat emissions, veteran truckers are quick to get behind the fact that pre-emission trucks are much more reliable than the current trucks of today. With much more sensors and electronics to deal with, simple problems can set you back thousands for a repair. Most prefer older models as there is less to go wrong, and they have more of an understanding of the mechanics of the engine.</h1>
