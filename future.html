                    <h2>Future</h2>
                    <h1 class="futurebody">As various innovations occur, we are starting to see the very first fully electric semi trucks. Although much better for the environment, production of the vehicles is one of the drawbacks for its seemingly smaller carbon footprint, this is called the break-even point. At the current date, not information is available for the semi’s break-even point. Some say that the truck is too expensive to be considered given that the price is expected to cost around $150,000 USD while an average diesel truck costs around $120,000.<br>Given that the price is higher, can it do the same work, if not better? Unfortunately, with current technology, the range of the Tesla Semi will be maxed out at 800km while the average diesel truck on the market can drive an average of 3300km. Skeptics are also worried of overburdening our grid with more EV’s on the road, won’t it drive up electricity costs? Yes, that is likely, unless more energy was being produced and entering the grid. In a world where we need to focus on the environmental impacts of everything we do, it is very cool to see that we are expanding into technology that helps us in the long run. Of course there still is numerous pro’s and con’s to this technology as with any new thing, there still is room to grow for battery technology in the future.</h1>
